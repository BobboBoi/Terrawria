# TERRAWRIA
This is my godot recreation of terraria.
It even has awful online multiplayer!

### Note
All textures, music files and sounds are excluded from this repo for copyright reasons.
Code is still cool tho... well aside from those two functions but the rest is cool.

Shout out to those random pc game pirating and hosting guys that thought this was a legit complete port. :)
